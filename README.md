# EC464 Senior Project: 40Hz Light Therapy

This README includes a brief overview and an introduction to how to get started on our project. 

## Project Overview

### Introduction

This project aims to develop an LED panel capable of emitting a consistent 40Hz flickering light. The 40Hz frequency is particularly chosen based on research suggesting its potential benefits in neurotherapeutic applications, especially for enhancing cognitive functions and possibly impacting disorders like Alzheimer's disease.

### Objectives

The primary objective of this project is to design and construct a reliable, efficient LED panel system that can maintain precise flicker frequencies, especially targeting the 40Hz range. Key goals include:

 - Precision: Achieve exact control over flicker frequency to ensure consistent 40Hz output.
 - Safety: Ensure the panel operates safely under all conditions, including extensive usage scenarios.
 - User-Friendliness: Develop a control interface that allows users to easily adjust and set the brightness as needed.

### Current State

The project has reached a significant milestone with the development of two final product models:

 - **T0 Model:** This is the base model featuring a large LED panel that can simply turn on and off, designed for stationary use where size and portability are not constraints.
 - **T9 Model:** A compact, innovative model that can attach to any modern smartphone case using Velcro. The T9 not only offers portability but also includes adjustable flickering brightness settings, making it ideal for personal use in a variety of settings.
