### CAD Design of T9 Housing
This is the CAD design for our T9 Housing. It consist of 2 buttons integrated, along with a hollow bridge that allows the wires to run from the circuit board to the LED that is placed along the small panel above. It also has an open area to allow users to plug in their power cable. The .stl file is under the _hardware_diagrams/CAD_ folder.
